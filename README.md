# Java-Mini-Project
Here I am going to upload my java mini project (i.e) Document Indexer. A document indexer in java is a program or component that indexes documents for efficient searching and retrieval. It typically involves processing documents such as text files, PDFs and web pages. 
An index is a vital component of a book, serving as a comprehensive roadmap to the content within its pages. 
This abstract outlines the design and functionality of an application created to generate an index for a given document. 
The program reads input from a specified text file, meticulously parsing the content to compile an index.
A concordance provides a detailed catalog of every word found within a document, accompanied by the line numbers where each word appears. 
This abstract describes the design and implementation of a program dedicated to creating a concordance for a given text file.
The importance of an index for researchers, scholars, and general readers is underscored, highlighting its role in streamlining information retrieval and enhancing the overall user experience.
The program reads a specified input text file and identifies significant words, excluding common terms and words with fewer than three characters.
The generated index is written to an output file, offering readers a quick and structured reference to locate specific terms within the document.
